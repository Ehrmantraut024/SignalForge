# SignalForge

SignalForge is a Python-based simulation tool for antenna array beamforming and evolutionary optimization.

There are two files:

1. Evolutionary_V1.py (It contains simulation and evolutionary algorithm. The evolutionary algorithm doesn't work well.)

2. Working_Sim.py (This is purely for simulation, it works fantastically. Evolutionary_V1, is this Working_sim.py + evolutionary algorithms. There is no work needed for this.)

## Features
- Add and visualize antenna arrays.
- Simulate beam propagation and pattern generation.
- Perform evolutionary optimization for antenna placement.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheTheoM/SignalForge
   ```
2. Install resources:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```
